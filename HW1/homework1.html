<p class="main">I'm originally from the midwest (Ohio), spent many years in Japan and now call the Bay Area home.  I live in north Oakland with my husband and work in the City.  In our spare time, we enjoy going to area festivals.  Some of our favorites are the <a href="https://www.sanleandro.org/depts/rec/special_events/cherry_festival/default.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Leandro Cherry Festival</a>, the <a href="https://www.baybookfest.org/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bay Area Book Festival</a> (downtown Berkeley), the <a href="https://sfcherryblossom.org/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Northern California Cherry Blossom Festival and Parade</a> (Japantown), <a href="http://www.mlaproductions.com/PaloAlto/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Palo Alto Arts Festival</a>, <a class="new" href="https://castrostreetfair.org/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Castro Street Fair</a>, <a href="https://annual.alamedacountyfair.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alameda County Fair</a> (Pleasanton) and <a href="https://www.christmasinthepark.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Jose's Christmas in the Park</a>.
<p class="main">My path to web-development has been in burst when needed at a particular moment - (compressing) and encoding videos for streaming, distributing documents, listing a directory of contacts when needed, etc.  My absolute (long-time) favorite website is <a href="https://flightaware.com/live/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flightaware.com</a> This website aggregates and flight data for almost all aircraft around the world and visualizes the information dynamically in real time on a map.  To me, it is an amazingly transparent representation of how interconnected our world is - I love it!</p>
